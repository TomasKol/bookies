This is my solution of the cs50w project1 - Books. https://docs.cs50.net/web/2019/x/projects/1/project1.html

Description: A small book-rating webapp with a database of 5000 books, using Goodreads' API for some additional info and providing an own API to the third parties.

Usage: After registering and logging in, search for a book by its title, author or ISBN. In case of positive match, click a book's box to get to the book's page with additional info about the book, goodreads rating and link to the book's page on googreads.com. Read the book's reviews by our other users and submit your own review. As a developer, access our data through our API at "/api/<isbn>".

Tech: Python + Flask + SQLAlchemy, PostgreSQL on Heroku, HTML, CSS, SASS, Bootstrap.
